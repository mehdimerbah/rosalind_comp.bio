# ROSALIND Computational Biology Solutions
This  a repository for my suggested solutions to the Computational Biology problems in [ROSALIND](rosalind.info). Rosalind offers an array of intellectually stimulating problems that grow in biological and computational complexity. The goal of this repo. is to follow up on my solutions to to the coding challenges on the platform.
